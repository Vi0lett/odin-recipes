        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Back home, grilled salmon with broccoli were my very favorite dish. I couldn't leave it out.</p>
        <p>I'm a big fan of tasty, healthy and practical (even more of a fan when it's cheap!), and this recipe seems to check all those boxes. I'm already salivating.</p>
