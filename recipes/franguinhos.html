        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This is probably my most used recipe. It's simple, healthy <strong>AND</strong> tasty. It's also the only recipe in this website I can actually make at the moment. :P</p>
        <p>Yes, it is a very simple grilled chicken recipe. But there is nothing wrong with simplicity. Hell of a lot better than noodles!</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Chicken fillet, <i>also known as sasami</i></li>
            <li>Olive oil</li>
            <li>Salt to taste
                <p>You probably need to add more than you expect, if you're a beginner</p> 
            </li>
            <li>Seasoning to taste
                <p>Personally, I'm a fan of <em>chimichurri</em>!</p>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>If necessary, cut the chicken into smallish fillets</li>
            <p><i>The type of chicken I usually buy - like sasami - will frequently be sold at an appropriately small size</i></p>
            <li>Cut each fillet open without actually splitting the piece</li>
            <p>This ensures the chicken will cook faster, and gives you more surface area to hold your seasoning of choice</p>
            <li>Add olive oil to a frying pan</li>
            <p>Ideally, you'll turn the fire on too so the oil can heat up and be ready by step 7.
                You might want to skip this step if you're very inexperienced in the kitchen
                and you need to take your time</p>
            <li>Salt each fillet, both sides</li>
            <li>Add the seasoning, both sides</li>
            <li><i>If you haven't turned the fire on on step 3, do it now and wait for the oil to heat up until it's sizzling</i></li>
            <li>Add fillets to the pan. Cook each side for <em>at least</em> 5 minutes</li>
            <p>I suggest you add a lid to the pan while it cooks. The steam should quicken the process and ensure the chicken is cooked evenly</p>
        </ol>
